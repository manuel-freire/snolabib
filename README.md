# snolabib

A bibliography generator for SNOLA

Generates web bibliography from a set of DBLP entries in a json file.

The resulting webpage is self-contained, but may reference external resources such as .js or .css files, depending on the template used. The default template includes js-powered interactive filtering based on author, year, and venue, and some css to make it look better.

Relies on [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de)'s well-curated bibtex and predictable behavior by citeproc-java to build correct webpages. Using less-consistent bibtex and/or a different bibtex-to-html engine will probably break stuff.

Requires:

* an authors file (see below) to know what to download
* [citeproc-java-tool-2.0.0](https://github.com/michel-kraemer/citeproc-java/releases/download/2.0.0/citeproc-java-tool-2.0.0.zip) to format it as ieee-with-url

## Authors file format

A json file with a single object, where the keys (with no spaces) are used to name downloaded author bibliographies, and for each author there is both a DBLP ID (either x/y, where both x and y are integers; or a/b, where a is a single letter and b is an actual name), and a full name.
