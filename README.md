# snolabib

A bibliography generator for SNOLA

Generates web bibliography from a set of DBLP entries in a json file.

The resulting webpage is by default self-contained. The default template includes js-powered, 0-dependency interactive filtering based on author, year, and venue, and some css to make it look better.

Relies on [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de)'s well-curated bibtex and predictable behavior by citeproc-java to build correct webpages. Using less-consistent bibtex and/or a different bibtex-to-html engine will probably break functionality.

Requires:

* an [authors](https://github.com/manuel-freire/snolabib/blob/main/authors.json) file to know what to download, and how to label researchers
* [citeproc-java-tool-2.0.0](https://github.com/michel-kraemer/citeproc-java/releases/download/2.0.0/citeproc-java-tool-2.0.0.zip) to format it as [ieee-with-url](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/ieee-with-url.csl)
